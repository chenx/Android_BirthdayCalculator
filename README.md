About
-----

This is essentially a Bill Calculator on tax, tip and per person split in a restaurant scene. On top of that it provides specialized functions for a birthday party, where the ideas come from a friend.

In the repository, BirthdayCalculator is the project. The other appcompat_v7 is the template project used by Eclipse. Both should be imported into Eclipse to set up the development environment.
