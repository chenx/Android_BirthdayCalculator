Android_BirthdayCalculator
==========================

An Android project: A Birthday Calculator.

About
-----

This is essentially a Bill Calculator on tax, tip and per person split in a restaurant scene. On top of that it provides specialized functions for a birthday party, where the ideas come from a friend.

In the repository, BirthdayCalculator is the project. The other appcompat_v7 is the template project used by Eclipse. Both should be imported into Eclipse to set up the development environment. The Product folder contains the apk file that can be used to install BirthdayCalculator on your Android Phone, and a screenshot image of the App.

You can download releases (including source code, installation apk file and screenshot image) from the <a href="https://github.com/chenx/Android_BirthdayCalculator/releases">release link above</a>.  The App is built with the setting of Android SDK min version 11 and target version 19. In other words, to install this App, you should have Android 3.0 (Honeycomb, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history">Android version history</a>) or above to be safely compatible.
